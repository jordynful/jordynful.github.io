          <p> In NMIX 4220, I had the opportunity to listen to experts in New Media industries,
            including those in different fields ranging from marketing to software engineering.
            The course also helped me develop effective professional skills as well as professional
            necessities(resumes, business cards, etc). During this semester I've read books and listened
            to lectures to help foster my growth in software development. My favorite assignment
            was learning more about myself, my personality type (ENTP) and the positions that suit me best.
            Lucky for me, my major matches up perfectly!

          <p> In NMIX 4310 I learned to develop IOS apps in SwiftUI. A few things a learned
            throughout this course: formatting apps using Vstacks, Hstacks, and Zstacks, creating different pages
            and link to them using NavigationViews and Links, Animating items, and UserDefault memory allocation.
            Below you can check out a few of the projects I developed this semester.
